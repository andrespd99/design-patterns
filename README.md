# Software Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of all known design patterns. These examples were exersises from [DevTalles course](https://cursos.devtalles.com/courses/patrones-diseno) on design patterns, which is actually taught in TypeScript, but I implemented them in Go.

You can read more about design patterns at Refactoring.Guru's [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) page, possibly the best resource on the subject.

Don't know what else to write here, so here's a potato.
